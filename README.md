# Custom HTML5 Video Player with Custom Skin

   This project involved taking a mockup and creating a custom-skinned HTML5 video player using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Functionality for video scrubbing, play/pause, mute/unmute, and fullscreen functionalities were implemented using jQuery. As the video plays, the captions below are highlighted at their corresponding video playback time.
